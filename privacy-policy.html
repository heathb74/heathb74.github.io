    <h1>GolfIQ Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: May 21, 2025</strong></p>
    <p>GolfIQ ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy and the privacy of children using our GolfIQ mobile application ("App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard personal information for all users, including children under 13, who may use the App with verifiable parental consent. By using the App, you (or your parent/guardian, if under 13) consent to the practices described herein, including the collection of golf performance data, precise location data, camera data, and the use of third-party services like the OpenAI API for AI-driven features. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect personal and non-personal information to provide and improve the App’s functionality. Personal information is data that can be linked to your identity. For children under 13, we collect personal information only with verifiable parental consent.</p>
    <h3>a. User Account Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Name</strong>: Your full name, if shared during Sign in with Apple authentication.</li>
        <li><strong>Email Address</strong>: Your email address, if provided, or a private email relay address generated by Apple.</li>
        <li><strong>User Identifier</strong>: A unique, anonymous identifier from Apple to authenticate your account.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may hide your email using Apple’s private email relay service. For children under 13, we require parental consent to collect this data.</p>

    <h3>b. Golf Performance Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Practice and Play Data</strong>: Information about golf activities, including courses played, scores, practice sessions (e.g., club used, shot distance, swing type, shot shape, hit location on the green, club impact), and AI-generated recommendations (e.g., suggested club or swing type). This data is linked to your user identifier and stored locally or synced via iCloud.</li>
        <li><strong>Search Queries</strong>: Terms entered to find golf courses (e.g., course names or locations).</li>
        <li><strong>Preferences</strong>: App settings, such as preferred tee boxes or practice configurations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For children under 13, we collect only the data necessary for the App’s core features, with parental consent.</p>

    <h3>c. Location Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Precise Location</strong>: Latitude and longitude collected for map-based features to display your position, calculate distances to a marker, or support course search and green analysis. Location access requires your explicit permission via iOS settings and, for children under 13, parental consent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>d. GreenReader Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera Data</strong>: Images or videos captured by the device’s camera for the GreenReader feature to analyze golf greens (e.g., for slope or break prediction). This data may include metadata (e.g., timestamps, course details) but is not intended to capture identifiable individuals. Camera access requires your explicit permission via iOS settings and, for children under 13, parental consent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>e. AI Interaction Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Inputs and Outputs</strong>: User inputs (e.g., text, speech transcriptions, golf performance data like shot statistics) and AI-generated responses (e.g., CaddyAI advice, club recommendations) sent to or received from the OpenAI API. For children under 13, AI features are limited and require parental consent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>f. Technical Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device Information</strong>: Device type, operating system version, and unique device identifiers (not linked to your identity).</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Information</strong>: App interactions (e.g., pages visited, features used, practice activity) to improve performance and user experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Other Sensor Data</strong>: If enabled, data from device sensors (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope) or integrations (e.g., wearables) to enhance golf tracking, subject to your permission and, for children under 13, parental consent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use your information to provide, personalize, and improve the App’s services, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Authentication</strong>: Verify your identity via Sign in with Apple for secure access.</li>
        <li><strong>Core Features</strong>: Deliver golf course information, track scores and practice sessions, sync data via iCloud, generate AI-driven insights (e.g., club recommendations, CaddyAI advice), analyze greens via GreenReader, and display your location or calculate distances on maps.</li>
        <li><strong>Personalization</strong>: Tailor recommendations, insights, and displays based on your golf performance, preferences, location, or camera data.</li>
        <li><strong>Improvement</strong>: Analyze usage patterns (e.g., practice sessions, AI interactions, map usage) to enhance features and performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication</strong>: Respond to inquiries or provide updates about the App (e.g., new features, policy changes).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For children under 13, we limit data use to what’s necessary for the App’s core functionality and obtain parental consent.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. We share information only in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Providers</strong>: With trusted providers to operate the App, including:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Apple iCloud</strong>: For secure storage and syncing of golf performance data (e.g., scores, practice sessions) using CloudKit’s private database.</li>
                <li><strong>Golf Course API</strong>: To retrieve course details based on search queries, receiving only the query, not personal information.</li>
                <li><strong>OpenAI API</strong>: To process golf performance data (e.g., shot statistics), user inputs, and potentially images, videos, or location data for AI-driven features (e.g., CaddyAI, club recommendations, GreenReader analysis). OpenAI receives only the data necessary and is contractually obligated to protect it, including for children under 13 with parental consent. See <a href="https://openai.com/privacy">OpenAI’s Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            These providers are bound by contracts to comply with applicable laws, including COPPA for children’s data. No other third parties receive your personal information unless explicitly disclosed.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements</strong>: To comply with laws, regulations, or legal processes (e.g., court orders).</li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers</strong>: In the event of a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your information may be transferred, with notice to you or your parent/guardian.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>We implement robust measures to protect your information, especially for children under 13:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Secure Storage</strong>: Authentication data is managed by Apple’s servers. Golf performance, location, and other app data are stored locally in the App’s secure container or synced via iCloud using CloudKit’s private database with end-to-end encryption. Data sent to the OpenAI API (e.g., shot statistics, GreenReader images) is transmitted securely and processed temporarily. Location data for map-based features is not persistently stored unless part of golf performance data synced via iCloud.</li>
        <li><strong>API Key Protection</strong>: API keys for the golf course API and OpenAI API are stored in the iOS Keychain.</li>
        <li><strong>Encryption</strong>: Data transmitted to iCloud, the golf course API, or OpenAI is encrypted using industry-standard protocols (e.g., HTTPS, TLS).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the unlikely event of a data breach, we will notify affected users (or parents/guardians for children under 13) and authorities within 72 hours, as required by laws like GDPR and COPPA.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your information only as long as necessary:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local and iCloud Data</strong>: Golf performance data, preferences, and other app data are retained until you (or your parent/guardian) delete them via the App, device settings, or iCloud settings.</li>
        <li><strong>OpenAI API Data</strong>: Data sent to OpenAI is not stored by GolfIQ and is processed temporarily. Contact OpenAI for their retention policies.</li>
        <li><strong>Account Data</strong>: User account data is retained until you revoke Sign in with Apple access.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For children under 13, we delete data promptly upon parental request or when no longer needed for the App’s services.</p>

    <h2>6. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your information may be processed in countries outside your jurisdiction, including the United States (e.g., by Apple, OpenAI). We ensure safeguards like Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers to countries without adequate data protection laws (e.g., from the EU). For children under 13, we ensure additional protections in line with COPPA and GDPR. Contact us for details.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>All users, including parents/guardians of children under 13, have the following rights, subject to applicable laws:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access</strong>: Request a copy of your (or your child’s) data (e.g., account details, golf performance data).</li>
        <li><strong>Rectification</strong>: Correct inaccurate data (e.g., update name via Apple ID settings).</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion</strong>: Delete your (or your child’s) account by revoking Sign in with Apple access. Delete app data (e.g., golf performance, GreenReader images, location data) by uninstalling the App, clearing data via device settings, deleting sessions in the App, or using the parental control interface (for children under 13). iCloud data can be removed via iCloud settings. OpenAI data is not stored by GolfIQ, but you may contact OpenAI for inquiries.</li>
        <li><strong>Portability</strong>: Request data in a structured, machine-readable format (e.g., exported practice sessions).</li>
        <li><strong>Restriction or Objection</strong>: Restrict or object to certain data processing, though this may limit App functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Location Access</strong>: Approve or revoke precise location access via iOS settings (or parental controls for children under 13). Revoking disables map-based features.</li>
        <li><strong>Camera Access</strong>: Approve or revoke camera access via iOS settings (or parental controls). Revoking disables GreenReader.</li>
        <li><strong>Hide Email</strong>: Use Apple’s private email relay to avoid sharing your real email.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise these rights, contact our Data Protection Officer at <a href="mailto:support@golfiq.app">support@golfiq.app</a>. We will respond within 30 days (or sooner if required). For children under 13, parents/guardians can manage data via the App’s parental control interface. If you do not consent to data sharing with OpenAI or location/camera access, do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is suitable for users of all ages, including children under 13, with verifiable parental consent in compliance with the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and GDPR (Article 8). We take extra precautions to protect children’s data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Parental Consent</strong>: For users under 13, we require verifiable parental consent (e.g., via email verification or third-party service) before collecting personal information. Without consent, children cannot access features requiring personal data (e.g., practice tracking, location, GreenReader).</li>
        <li><strong>Parental Controls</strong>: Parents/guardians can review, delete, or restrict their child’s data via the App’s parental control interface, accessible after verifying their identity.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Minimization</strong>: We collect only the data necessary for the App’s core features and limit third-party sharing (e.g., OpenAI) for children.</li>
        <li><strong>Security</strong>: Children’s data is protected with enhanced encryption and access controls.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If we learn personal information from a child under 13 has been collected without consent, we will delete it promptly. Parents/guardians can contact us at <a href="mailto:support@golfiq.app">support@golfiq.app</a> to report concerns or manage their child’s data.</p>

    <h2>9. Third-Party Links</h2>
    <p>The App may link to third-party services (e.g., golf course API, OpenAI). We are not responsible for their privacy practices. Review their policies, especially for children’s data, before providing information.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will notify users (and parents/guardians for children under 13) of material changes via the App, email, or a prominent notice before they take effect. The updated policy will be effective upon posting, with the “Last Updated” date revised.</p>
